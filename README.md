# CityTeam Stats Application

Welcome to the CityTeam Stats Application, designed to assist CityTeam
Facilities in accumulating daily operational statistics that need
to be reported to the Home Office periodically.

The software is built upon open source and/or free software components
(Postgres database, Node.JS, Typescript, Express, Sequelize, React, Axios)
and can be installed in environments ranging from a standalone (everything
installed on a single laptop) to a cloud based environment, supporting
multiple Facilities.

Detailed instructions for installing this application (for either
production use or development):
* [Installation Documentation](./INSTALLATION.md) - Installation.

Additional information for application developers:
* [Developer Documentation](./DEVELOPER.md) - Setting up your environment.
* [Application Design Documentation](./DESIGN.md) - Architecture breakdown.
