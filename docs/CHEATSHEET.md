# Configuration Cheat Sheet

This document provides a convenient place to record all of the configuration
settings you use, such as usernames and passwords, URLs for the database and
log files, and so on.  We suggest that you print out this sheet, record the
values as they are created, and **keep the printed copy in a secure place**
so that you can refer to it later.

DEVELOPER NOTE:  These values contain sensitive information, and should
**never** be recorded in a source control system like Git.
