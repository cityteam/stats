# CityTeam Stats Application

Welcome to the CityTeam Stats Application, designed to assist CityTeam
Facilities in accumulating daily operational statistics that need to be
reported to the Home Office periodically.

[CityTeam](https://cityteam.org) offers programs for outreach to, and
support of homeless communities, as well as recovery from addition,
in several US cities.  See their website for more information.

The information covered is targeted for different user types, with
separate pages customized to your needs:
* [I need to enter statistics](./USER.md).  You can operate the
  application through a standard web browser, or (on a table or mobile
  phone) by downloading an application from the Amazon Appstore.
* [I need to administer the statistics being recorded](./ADMIN.md).  Your
  username and password will provide access to additional features that
  let you set the required statistics for your CityTeam Facility.
* [I need to install the application locally](./INSTALL.md).  Our facility
  prefers to run the application on our local network, instead of using
  the version on the Internet.
* [I need to work on the software that drives this application(./DEVELOP.md)].
  The source code for the entire application is open source, and available
  [at GitHub](https://cityteam.github.com/stats).  You will need to install
  a local version (see the [installation instructions](./INSTALL.md) and
  then the extra information found here.
